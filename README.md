# chatgptetris

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris using JavaScript. The code in this repository has been generated using the ChatGPT language model by OpenAI.

## Description

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player aims to complete horizontal lines by moving and rotating falling blocks. As the lines are cleared, the player earns points and the game becomes progressively faster.

This implementation includes features such as block movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, and game over condition. The code has been automatically generated by the ChatGPT language model based on the provided prompts.

Please note that while the code has been written by ChatGPT, any modifications, improvements, and additional features can be made by human developers.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/relluf/chatgptetris.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd chatgptetris
   ```

3. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## How to Play

- Move the falling block left: Use the left arrow key.
- Move the falling block right: Use the right arrow key.
- Rotate the falling block: Use the up arrow key.
- Drop the falling block instantly: Use the spacebar.
- Pause the game: Use the Escape key.

## Scoring System

The game includes a scoring system based on the Game Boy Tetris version:

- Points for clearing lines: 40 * (level + 1).
- Additional points for clearing multiple lines simultaneously:
  - 1 line: 0 points.
  - 2 lines: 100 points.
  - 3 lines: 300 points.
  - 4 lines (Tetris): 1200 points.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a high score tracking feature.
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Improve the user interface and game graphics.
