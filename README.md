## Description

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player aims to complete horizontal lines by moving and rotating falling blocks. As the lines are cleared, the player earns points and the game becomes progressively faster.

This implementation includes features such as block movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, and game over condition. The code has been automatically generated by the ChatGPT language model based on the provided prompts.

Please note that while the code has been written by ChatGPT, any modifications, improvements, and additional features can be made by human developers.
