* Install a server
* The game should keep track of the following statistics
	* √ Score
	* √ Number of lines completed
	* Time playing
	* Number of blocks
	* Number of blocks, per Tetrimino
	* Number of Tetris in a Row
* Smooth animations for dropping, moving and rotating
	* Lines completed -> Whoosh!
	* Fade away
	* Fall away
* Drop should occur at the start of the next "block-frame"
* Game Over state
	* Game Boy like animation
* Scoring
	* Combo, Supercombo, Ultracombo, etc.
* Make 5 suggestions to make the even more fun to play
* The game should keep track on the movements the player makes, so that it can be rewinded and/or replayed (eg. upon game over)
* Anticipate an iPad-like device and introduce big buttons in order to be able to manipulate and move the block as fast as possible
	* device independent
* I want a glow effect around the edges of the current block
	* This glow should be rendered with seperate elements so that it can animate when the block is rotated
* Two Players (all over the world!)
* Suggest code changes to log message during the game so that you can analyse my game play
* Simulate Game Boy's selection look and feel of the game
* When playing with players, both players should get the same blocks in the same sequence
* The next block should be made visible
* When a block is dropped, the lines should clear immediately
* When a line is cleared, it should blink for a while
* Describe the scoring system of Tetris
* Each drop should have the same the delay before the next game state is rendered
* √ Colors of merged blocks should be darker
* √ When the game is paused, the board should show distorted
* √ Het huidige blok moet ook andersom kunnen worden gedraaid. Introduceer een er ook een nieuwe button voor. 
* √ Genereer code die de volgende toets naar actie mapping implementeert
	* Left -> moveBlockLeft
	* Right -> moveBlockRight
	* Up -> rotateBlock
	* Space -> dropBlock
	* Escape -> pauseGame
* √ Rotating the block seems off. Toggling between counter and clockwise seems off as well. It doesn't feel natural, or at least not like it does on the Game Boy. 
* √ When I make a Tetris (ie. four lines), it's Game Over! I press Escape twice and the game resumes
* √ The game still suffers from a bug, when a block is not specifically dropped (by using the spacebar), game stop and logs "Game Over!"

# `2023/05/25` Scoring system by Game Boy version of Tetris

The scoring system in Game Boy Tetris encourages players to clear multiple lines at once and reach higher levels to earn more points. It adds an element of strategy and challenge to the game as you aim for higher scores.

Here's a breakdown of the scoring system in Game Boy Tetris:

* 1. **Line Clear Points**: Each time you clear lines, you earn points based on the number of lines cleared. Clearing more lines at once, such as a Tetris, gives you a higher point bonus.

> - Single Line Clear: 40 points
- Double Line Clear: 100 points
- Triple Line Clear: 300 points
- Tetris (Four Line Clear): 1200 points

* 2. **Level Bonus**: As the level increases, the game becomes faster, and you earn a bonus score multiplier. The multiplier increases the points you earn from line clears. For example, at level 0, you earn the base points mentioned above. But as the level increases, the points are multiplied by a factor. The exact multiplier values may vary depending on the version of Tetris, but generally, it ranges from 1x to 5x or more.

> - The game starts at level 0 and increases by 1 for every 10 lines cleared.

* 3. **Soft Drop Points**: The soft drop points are usually lower than line clear points but can contribute to your overall score.

> - When you use the soft drop feature (pressing the Down arrow to make the block fall faster), you earn additional points for each cell moved.

Ok, one could check the chat to see what has been happening. But some nice progress has already been made, by just going back and forth between ChatGPT for code-generation, Cavalion-docs for pasting and the browser to test.


# `2023/05/25` Scoring system

A scoring system can add an element of challenge and competition to your game. Here's a suggestion for a scoring system for your Tetris game:

1. Line Clear Points:
   Assign a certain number of points for each line cleared. The more lines cleared simultaneously, the higher the points awarded. For example:
   - 1 line cleared: 100 points
   - 2 lines cleared: 300 points
   - 3 lines cleared: 500 points
   - 4 lines cleared (Tetris): 800 points

2. Level Points:
   As the game progresses and the player reaches higher levels, increase the points earned for each line clear. This adds an incentive for players to advance to higher levels. For example, you can increase the line clear points by a certain factor for each level increase.

3. Drop Points:
   Award additional points for each block dropped instantly to the bottom. The points can be based on the distance the block falls. For example, you can award 10 points for each grid square the block drops instantly.

4. Bonus Points:
   You can introduce bonus points for achieving certain milestones or special achievements in the game. For example, award bonus points for clearing a certain number of lines, reaching a high score, or performing complex moves like back-to-back Tetris clears.

5. Time-based Points:
   Consider adding a time-based scoring component where players earn points based on their efficiency in clearing lines within a given time frame. For example, award bonus points for clearing lines within a specific time limit or implementing a combo system where consecutive line clears within a certain time interval yield increasing bonus points.

With this scoring system, players can aim to achieve high scores by clearing lines, dropping blocks strategically, and performing skillful moves. You can display the current score on the game screen to provide feedback to the player and encourage them to improve their gameplay.

Feel free to customize and tweak the scoring system to fit your game mechanics and desired level of difficulty. The goal is to create a rewarding and engaging experience for the players.

"From now on, I want you to act as a programming instructor, specifically focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Imagine we are creating a simple version of the game Tetris for a browser. 

First, explain the overall structure of the game and how it should function from a user's perspective. Then, guide me through setting up the basic HTML structure for the game, including areas for the game board and any needed controls or scores.

Next, discuss how we could represent the Tetris blocks and the game board using JavaScript data structures. Provide some examples of how we can manipulate these data structures to simulate the movement and rotation of blocks, as well as the detection of complete lines.

Then, delve into the CSS styling for the game, explaining how to make the blocks and game board visually distinct and attractive. 

Finally, guide me through the game loop and how to use JavaScript's timing functions to control the game speed, as well as how to respond to user inputs like moving, rotating, and dropping blocks. After that, explain how to handle game states like game over and restarting a game."
